                    <p>
                        Web security is the set of technologies, tactics, and policies that companies employ to protect their computer systems, clients, and information assets against many forms of online attacks.<br>
                        Security of Web rely on four basic principles: authentication, encryption, network security, and incident response.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Internet security:</h2>
                    <p>Internet security is concerned with the protection of online activities and transactions. It is a subset of bigger sciences such as cybersecurity and computer safety, and its topics include browser privacy, safe online habits, and network communication security.<br>
                        When the internet security is strong, it protects the laptops, desktops, and more devices from harm.

                    <h2>Common risks and safe practices:</h2>
                    <h3>- Computer Viruses:</h3>
                    <h4>Risks:</h4>
                    <p>Viruses are one of the most frequently encountered risks. They link themselves to files or networks and, if initiated, can either do instant damage or remain concealed until triggered. Their main objective is to propagate to other machines and related networks.</p>
                    <h4>Safe practices:</h4>
                    <p>Set up a network security system to prevent unauthorized external access. While not perfect, it does slow down or dissuade assaults. Use it with protection from antivirus programs to increase security.</p>
                    <h3>- Malware:</h3>
                    <h4>Risks:</h4>
                    <p>Malware, including ransomware, may infect your data and lock them till a ransom payment is paid. These assaults usually start in databases, where information is protected by encryption and threatened with erasure. Unexplained system slowdowns are a prevalent indicator.</p>
                    <h4>Safe practices:</h4>
                    <p>To ensure safety, unplug from the internet and shut down if suspicious behavior is detected. Scan for viruses with security tools, then install credible antivirus software in conjunction with your firewall.</p>
                    <h3>- Phishing:</h3>
                    <h4>Risks:</h4>
                    <p>Phishing attacks personal information, including passwords, usernames, and financial details. To steal credentials, attackers pretend to themselves as trusted businesses or contacts and send messages or email addresses with bogus URLs.</p>
                    <h4>Safe practices:</h4>
                    <p>To ensure safety, always verify the sender's identity before opening any communications. Be careful of links, particularly if the email includes grammar problems. Invest in security measures that include phishing protection to reduce hazards.</p>
                    <h3>- SQL injection:</h3>
                    <h4>Risks:</h4>
                    <p>SQL injection involves putting malicious code into vulnerable databases, letting attackers to view, edit, or delete stored data.</p>
                    <h4>Safe practices:</h4>
                    <p>Constantly update software for database management and security updates. Avoid using the same database accounts across several apps, and employ secure coding techniques.</p>
